# Personal Website

A simple portfolio that I made for myself using Polymer/Web Components. The main purpose of this project was to try to teach myself webcomponents (while also giving my portfolio a much needed update). 

The whole structure of the project is simple with a few components. Most of the components are simple structures with a some state logic + event handling. 

There are two branches for this project. The master branch is the branch that Github looks at and contains the build content. 
The develop branch is the branch where all the dev changes are applied. 

To view the application locally, run the following command:
```
$ polymer serve
```

To build:
```
$ polymer build
```
